            <p class="para">
                When Ericsson Response volunteers arrive in a disaster zone, their role is to enable temporary voice and
                data connectivity so that humanitarian relief agencies can quickly coordinate their relief efforts.
                Ericsson Response works together with relief agencies, governments and local authorities to prioritise
                deployments in affected areas, using its telecoms skills and technology to bring together the aid
                organizations that help alleviate the affected populations. Volunteers remain in the affected areas
                enhancing and maintaining networks and equipment until local services have sufficiently recovered or
                until the temporary network capacity is no longer needed.<br><br>
                Based entirely on staff volunteers, Ericsson Response has helped out in humanitarian disasters for 20
                years, in a wide variety of situations around the world.<br><br>
                The key role of Ericsson Response is to install and maintain temporary internet connectivity until local
                services have sufficiently recovered or until increased capacity is no longer needed.

                            <p>Ericsson Response is a volunteer initiative that provides communications expertise,
                                equipment and resources in times of a disaster. In this podcast, one volunteer chats
                                with the program director about the origins and purpose of Ericsson Response.</p>

                            <p>Since its establishment in 2000, Ericsson Response has consistently demonstrated the
                                powerful role information and communication technology (ICT) can play in relief efforts
                                by providing internet access to humanitarian workers in disaster areas. I myself became
                                an Ericsson Response volunteer in 2006 and the program has been an important part of my
                                life ever since. Over the course of the past 10+ years, I have participated in several
                                field missions as well as doing back-office support and development work, and preparing
                                systems for deployment.</p>

                            <p>Earlier this month, I had the privilege of travelling to Link√∂ping (Sweden) to take part
                                in the weeklong training program to become an Ericsson Response volunteer. Ericsson
                                Response is a global initiative in which Ericsson works in partnership with UN agencies
                                such as the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the World Food
                                Programme (WFP), and UNICEF, and NGOs such as the Red Cross and Save the Children, to
                                provide telecommunications and internet support in disaster situations.</p>
